## About

TrayDrop is an open-source program that allows you to upload files and clipboard content to the server and automatically synchronize between devices. Traydrop is lightweight and the client will run even on the slowest machines as long as they have 500MB of free RAM. We offer a [PC client](https://github.com/onhq11/TrayDrop), [Mobile app](https://github.com/onhq11/TrayDrop-Android) and [Website](https://github.com/onhq11/Traydrop-Website) and it's all fully synchronized with each other. If you want to set up a server yourself, you can do it using our [Laravel server repository](https://github.com/Szurag/TraydropLaravel). There you will find a guide on how to do it and enjoy your private server

## Features

- Cross-platform clipboard and files synchronization
- Encrypted passwords, files and clipboards
